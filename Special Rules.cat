      <description>&quot;A Player scores less Victory Points when they destroy a Unit that includes only Models with this Special Rule.&quot;
The number of Victory Points scored by the opponent when a Unit that includes only Models with this Special Rule is entirely Removed as Casualties, for example, as part of the Vanguard (X) Special Rule, First Strike (X) or Slay the Warlord (X) Mission Special Rule, is reduced by the value of X, to a minimum of 1. If a Unit includes Models with different variants of this Special Rule, then the lowest value of X that was present on any Model in that Unit at the start of the Player Turn in which the last Model in the Unit is Removed as a Casualty is used to determine the effect of this Special Rule on that Unit.

Note that, if, at the start of the Player Turn a Unit includes any Models that do not have this Special Rule, then this Special Rule has no effect on that Unit for the duration of that Player Turn regardless of how many other Models in the Unit may have any variant of this Special Rule.</description>

      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Shred (X) Special Rule can sometimes inflict an extra point of Damage&quot;
When any Wound Test is made for an attack with the Shred (X) Special Rule, if the result of the Dice roll, before any modifiers are applied, is equal to or greater than the value of X attached to this variant of the Shred (X) Special Rule, then if a wound is inflicted by that Wound Test , the Damage of that wound is increased by 1.

      <description>&quot;This Special Rule allows the Controlling Player to reduce the Reaction Point cost of a Reaction once per Turn.&quot;

Once per Turn, if a Unit that contains any Model with this Special Rule is within 18&quot; of a Unit that makes a Reaction, the Controlling Player can make an Intelligence Check for this Unit. If a Model from the Unit with this Special Rule has Line of Sight to a Model in the Reacting Unit, the Controlling Player can modify the result of that Check by -1. If the Check is successful, that Reaction costs one fewer Reaction Points (to a minimum of 0).</description>

      <description>&quot;A Unit that contains Models with this Special Rule scores fewer Victory Points for Controlling Objective Markers.&quot;
A Unit that includes any Models with the Support Unit (X) Special Rule may only ever score a maximum number of Victory Points equal to the value of X for Controlling an Objective, regardless of the Value of that Objective, or any other Special Rules Models in that Unit might have (such as the Line (X) Special Rule).</description>

      <description>&quot;With a Weapon that has a Breaching (X) Special Rule there is a chance that a Wound Test may result in the Wound ignoring Armour Saves.&quot;
When any Wound Test is made for an attack with the Breaching (X) Special Rule, if the result of the Dice roll, before any modifiers are applied, is equal to or greater than the value of X attached to this variant of the Breaching (X) Special Rule, then if a wound is inflicted by that Wound Test, that wound becomes a &apos;Breaching Wound&apos;.

A Breaching Wound is always treated as having an AP of 2 regardless of the Characteristics of the Weapon used to make the attack.</description>

When making a Shooting Attack with a Weapon that has the Heavy (X) Special Rule, a modifier of +1 is added to a Characteristic if the Model with that Weapon is part of a Unit that remained Stationary in the Controlling Playerâ€™s previous Movement Phase. If the Characteristic listed is AP, then instead it improves the AP by one Step. The value of X in the specific variant of the Heavy (X) Special Rule determines which Characteristic gains the +1 modifier.</description>

When making a Shooting Attack with a Weapon that has the Ordnance (X) Special Rule, a modifier of x2 is applied to a Characteristic if the Model with that Weapon is part of a Unit that remained stationary in the Controlling Player&apos;s previous Movement Phase (if that Characteristic is AP, then the AP is instead changed to AP 2). The value of X in the specific variant of the Ordnance (X) Special Rule determines which Characteristics gains the x2 Modifier.</description>

      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Blast (X) Special Rule use a Blast Marker to determine how many Hits are caused.&quot;
When making attacks with a Weapon that has the Blast (X) Special Rule, before any Hit Tests are made, a Blast Marker must first be placed to determine how many Hits may be inflicted by the attack. The Player making the attack must place the Blast Marker indicated in brackets as part of the Special Rule so that the hole in the middle is entirely over the base of any one model in the Target Unit. Once the blast Marker has been placed, the Player making the attack must make a Hit Test for the attack, and each Model from the Target Unit that is fully or partially under the Blast Marker will suffer 1 Hit if the Hit Test is successful.

*Hits on Other Units*
If any Models form Units other than the Target Unit are fully or partially covered by the Blast Marker, then a new Fire Group must be created for those Hits and set to one side. Continue resolving the Shooting Attack on the original Target Unit, and once that Shooting Attack has been completely resolved begin a new Shooting Attack to resolve those additional Fire Groups generated for Units other than the original Target Unit.

If the Hit Test is unsuccessful then no Hits are inflicted and the Player making the attack must make a Scatter Roll for the Blast Marker (see the Rules for Scatter in the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy - Age of Darkness Rulebook). Once a Scatter Roll has been made for the Blast Marker and it has been moved, one Hit is inflicted on a Unit for each Model from that Unit that is wholly or partially covered by the Blast Marker.</description>

    <rule name="Template" id="7df2-9e88-3285-cf6a" hidden="false" page="310" publicationId="b905-0414-1057-bb34">
      <description>&quot;Weapons and attacks with the Template Special Rule use the Flame Template to determine how many Models they Hit.&quot;
When making attacks for a Weapon or other effect that has the Template Special Rule, or otherwise uses a Template , no Hit Tests are made for the attack. Instead, when directed to make Hit Tests for such an attack, a single Template is placed to determine how many Hits are generated. A Template must be placed so that its narrow end is touching the Base of the Model, the edge of a Model&apos;s Hull (if it has the Vehicle Type) or other point being used to make the attack, and so that no part of the Template covers or touches a friendly Model&apos;s Base, Hull or otherwise would inflict Hits on a friendly Model. Within these restrictions, the Player making the attack may place the Template in an orientation of their choosing as long as at least one Model from the original Target Unit remains under the Template. If the Template cannot be placed under these restrictions, such as if it cannot be placed without covering or touching friendly Models, then no attack may be made.

Once the Template has been placed, a number of Hits using the Profile of the Weapon or effect are inflicted on the Target Unit equal to the number of Models touched or covered by the Template. If the Weapon or attack has a Firepower Characteristic greater than 1 then only a single Model touched or covered by the Template is equal to the Firepower Characteristic of the attack or Weapon. If more than one enemy Unit has Models that are touched or covered by the Template in its final position, then Hits are inflicted on all such Units as noted above, Hits on Units other than the original target form a new Fire Group that must be placed to one side and used to resolve a separate Shooting Attack on the additional Target Unit once all attacks and Fire Groups from the original Shooting Attack have been fully resolved. When resolving Armour Penetration Tests for Hits inflicted by a Weapon with this Special Rule, the position of the Model that was used to make the attack is used to determine which Armour Facing is used.


Note that the Rules require template to be placed in Base Contact with the Model being used to make the attack, but his Model is not counted as having been Hit by the attack and does not stop the attack from being made. However, this only applies to the individual Model being used to make the attack, not to other Models in the same Unit.


Weapons with this Special Rule will have their Range Characteristic as &apos;Template&apos;. This does not count as a value of &apos;0&apos; or &apos;-&apos;. If a Rule requires a number for the Range Characteristic (other than for making attacks, which must be conducted using the Rules noted above) then all Weapons and attacks with this Special Rule are considered to have a Range Characteristic of &apos;8&apos;.


*Other Templates*
In some rare cases a Weapon may use a different Template than the standard Flame Template, in these cases the Template Rule maybe expressed with a bracketed section stating which Template must be used when attack with that Weapon. Otherwise, the Rules for its use are unchanged from those noted under the Template Special Rule.


An example of this is the use of the Hellstorm Template for certain very large Weapons. In this case the Rule would be expressed as &apos;Template (Hellstorm)&apos; and the attack would be resolved using the Template Special Rule, but placing the larger Hellstorm Template.</description>

    <rule name="Deep Strike" id="0553-d06b-52b9-34db" hidden="false" page="296" publicationId="b905-0414-1057-bb34">
      <description>&quot;The Deep Strike Special Rule allows a Unit to enter play anywhere on the Battlefield.&quot;
A Unit that includes only Models with the Deep Strike Special Rule that enters play from Reserves may make a Deep Strike instead of deploying a described in the Reserves Rules. No more than one Unit may attempt a Deep Strike in a given Player Turn. The Unit attempting a Deep Strike may have another Unit without the Deep Strike Special Rule Embarked Upon it if the Deep Striking Unit includes models with the Transport Sub-Type (note that some Missions may allow more Units to attempt a Deep Strike in the same Player Turn. This will be specifically noted in the Mission Special Rules section of that Mission.) Note that in Missions where the Reserves Mission Special Rule is not in use, the Deep Strike Special Rule has no effect. Furthermore, Units may not make use of the Deep Strike Special Rule during the first Battle Turn, even if they enter play from Reserves.

To perform a Deep Strike, the Active Player must declare an Eligible Unit that has entered play from Reserves in the Reserves Sub-Phase as the Deep Striking Unit. The Active Player must then select one Model from that Unit and place it anywhere on the Battlefield. This Model must be placed at least 1&quot;&quot; away from any enemy Model, Battlefield Edge or piece of Impassable Terrain. Once this first Model has been placed, the remaining Models in the Unit must be placed within Unit Coherency with at least one other Model in the same Unit and withing 6&quot;&quot; of the first Model placed. No Models may be placed within 1&quot;&quot; of an enemy Model, any Battle Field Edge or a piece of Impassable Terrain. Any Models that cannot be placed using these Rules must be Removed as a Casualty immediately. This deployment must take place during the Reserve Sub-Phase, and a Unit that deploys as a Deep Strike may not move in the Move Sub-Phase of the same Player Turn or have a Charge declared for it in the Charge Sub-Phase of the same Player Turn, but may make Shooting Attacks as normal. A Unit that is Embarked on a Model that is deployed as part of a Deep Strike may Disembark during the Move Sub-Phase of the same Player Turn, but may not make any move other than the move made to Disembark and may not have a Charge declared for it in the Charge Sub-Phase of the same Player Turn.

Enemy Units may declare Intercept Reactions against a Unit deployed as part of a Deep Strike, but not Reposition Reactions.</description>

    <rule name="Overload (X)" id="1d3a-d1e2-871a-63ae" hidden="false" page="304" publicationId="b905-0414-1057-bb34">
      <description>&quot;Weapons with this Special Rule may inflict Hits on the Models making Shooting Attacks with them.&quot;
When the Controlling Player declares that attacks will be made for a Model using a Weapon or Profile that has the Overload (X) Special Rule, any Hit Tests made for those attacks that result in a number that is equal to or less than the value of X attached to the variant of the Overload Special Rule that the Weapon had, before any modifiers are applied to the roll, are Misfires.

For Weapons that do not make Hit Tests, such as Weapons with the Template Special Rule, instead roll a number of Dice equal to the Firepower Characteristic of the Weapon used to make the attack after the attack has been declared and the number of Models hit is determined. Each Dice that results in a number equal to or less than the value of X attached to the variant of the Overload Special Rule that the Weapon had creates a Misfire. This does not affect the number of Hits on the Target Unit created by this attack.

For each Misfire, the Unit for which the Hit Tests were made suffer a Hit - these Hits must form a new Fire Group or Strike Group, referred to as the &apos;Misfire Group&apos;.

Once the current Shooting Attack and any Reactions triggered by it have been fully resolved, the Misfire Group must be resolved. A Misfire Group is resolved in the same way as any other Fire Group or Strike Group, using the Profile of the Weapon used for the Fire Group or Strike Group it was created from. Wounds, Glancing Hits, or Penetrating Hits from this Misfire Group are allocated by the Controlling Player, and must be allocated toa Model that made attacks as part of the Fire Group or Strike Group that generated the Misfire Group. If a Hit from a Misfire Group is generated by an attack made by a Model with the Vehicle Type, then it is resolved against the lowest Armour Value from all of the Model&apos;s facings.

Hits, Wounds, or Casualties inflicted upon a Unit as a result of this Special Rule do not cause Leadership or Cool Checks, and Hits inflicted as part of a Misfire Group do not trigger any Special Rules that take effect as a result of a certain value on a Hit Test.</description>

      <description>&quot;This Special Rule increases the amount of Damage against Vehicles when Shooting Attacks are made withing a specific range.&quot;
If at least one Model in a Unit with the Vehicle Type that is targeted by a Shooting Attack made by a Model using a Weapon with this Special Rule is within a range equal to or less than the value specified by X, that attack has the Armourbane Special Rule and the Damage of Penetrating Hits caused by that attack is doubled.</description>

      <description>&quot;A Weapon with the Duellist&apos;s Edge (X) Special Rule grants a bonus to Focus Rolls in Challenges.&quot;
In Step 3 of the Challenge Sub-Phase, the Focus Step, if a Player has declared that the Model under their control will use a Weapon with the Duellist&apos;s Edge (X) Special Rule or has the Duellist&apos;s Edge (X) Special Rule, then that Player gains a bonus equal to the value of X on the Focus Roll.</description>

      <description>&quot;On a successful Charge, a Model with the Impact (X) Special Rule temporarily increases a Characteristic by 1.&quot;
If a Unit that includes any Models with the Impact (X) Special Rule or any Models that have any Weapons with the Impact (X) Special Rule, and that Unit makes a successful Charge, then this Special Rule is triggered. Once triggered, until the end of that Assault Phase, when making Melee Attacks for Models in that Unit, each Model or Weapon that is selected for one of those Models, that has a variant of this Special Rule, gains a modifier of +1 to any Characteristics that is the value of X.</description>

      <description>&quot;Attacks made with the Critical Hit (X) Special Rule have a chance to automatically cause a wound and inflict 1 extra point of Damage.&quot;
When any Hit Test is made for an attack with the Critical Hit (X) Special Rule, if the result of the Dice Roll, before any modifiers are applied, is equal to or greater than the value of X attached to this variant of the Critical Hit (X) Special Rule, then if a Hit is inflicted by that Hit Test, that Hit becomes a &apos;Critical Hit&apos;.

A Critical Hit automatically inflicts a wound without any dice being rolled, counting as the roll of a &apos;6&apos; for any variable Special Rules that might be triggered by a Wound Test, and increases the Damage of the Hit by +1.</description>

      <description>&quot;A Weapon with this Special Rule may be used to attack Target Units out of Line of Sight.&quot;
If a Unit for which a Shooting attack is made includes any Models with one or more Weapons with this Special Rule, then in Step 2 of the Shooting Attack process they may ignore the restriction on requiring Line of Sight to a Target Unit. If a Player uses this Special Rule to declare a Shooting Attack on a Unit that the attacking Unit cannot draw a Line of Sight to, then in Step 3 of the Shooting Attack process that Player may only declare attacks with Weapons that have this Special Rule.

If a Weapon with this Special Rule and the Blast (X) Special Rule is used to attack a Unit without a Line of Sight to that Unit, then no Hit Test is made and an Indirect Scatter Roll must be made for the Blast Marker placed as part of the attack. If such a Weapon makes more than a single attack then a separate Indirect Scatter Roll is made for each attack. When making an Indirect Scatter Roll for such an attack, the number of Dice rolled alongside the Scatter Dice is determined by the value of X for the Weapon with the Barrage (X) Special Rule, the value of these Dice is then totalled to find the distance the attack Scatters.</description>

      <description>&quot;If a Model with this Special Rule is outnumbered, it gains extra attacks.&quot;
If a Model is outnumbered in Combat and either has this Special Rule or is made to attack with a Weapon that has this Special Rule, then that Model gains a bonus to its Attacks Characteristic equal to the value of X attached to the variant of this Special Rule it has access to. To be considered outnumbered, the total number of friendly Models Locked in Combat in the same Combat must be less than the total number of enemy Models Locked in Combat in the same Combat - Models with the Bulky (X) Special Rule count as a number of Models equal to the value of X in the Variant of the Bulky (X) Special Rule that Model has. This Special Rule has no effect during the Challenge Sub-Phase, and no Model that is Engaged in a Challenge may gain additional Attacks due to this Special Rule.</description>
